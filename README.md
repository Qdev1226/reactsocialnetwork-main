## Overview

This app is made with:

[![Express](https://img.shields.io/badge/Express.js-404D59?style=for-the-badge)](https://expressjs.com)
[![React](https://img.shields.io/badge/React-20232A?style=for-the-badge&logo=react&logoColor=61DAFB)](https://react.dev/)
[![NodeJS](https://img.shields.io/badge/Node.js-43853D?style=for-the-badge&logo=node.js&logoColor=white)](https://www.nodejs.com)
[![MaterialUI](https://img.shields.io/badge/Material--UI-0081CB?style=for-the-badge&logo=material-ui&logoColor=white)](https://www.mui.com)

Our development environment backend includes SQLite instead of MongoDB for development purposes only.

This app was bootstrapped with Create-React-App v5 aka react-scripts by running `npx create-react-app reactsocialmedia`

This is a full stack MERN social media application that allows users to create and share posts, join and also create events and groups. Our main core focus is on friends, groups and events.

This design is based on community driven developent and as such there is no particular design we are going for just yet.  We have a reusable component called Panel to make contributing new components and features easier.  You should be able to easily submit a design that will work with the design we
have already started working with.  If we like the design of the component, feature, panel or other item, we will merge it if the item has been tested as working.

## Features

- Groups
- Events
